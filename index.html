       <h1>Filipino Spaghetti Recipe</h1>
       <img src="media/spaghetti1.jpg" alt="Filipino Spaghetti" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
       <h3>History</h3>
       <p>The heavily loved Filipino dish dates back as early as the 1940s-1960s. During the American Commonwealth Period, there was a shortage of tomatos in World War II which lead to the development of <i>banana ketchup</i>. The Americans then introduced the traditional Italian cuisine, Spaghetti, to the people in the Philippine Islands. With the addition of Banana Ketchup, soon after, it was tweaked according to the Filipino's taste for sweet dishes.
       <br>
       <p>This recipe makes an easy-simple <u><b>Filipino Spaghetti</b></u>; the uniqueness of tasting the smoky hotdogs alongside the sweet-cheesy sauce is what make it so loved by the Filipinos!
